quote: "THE DUST HAS SETTLED, THE RENOVATION WORK IS 99.99% COMPLETE, THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ARE SETTLED AND I AM NOW BACK TO MY \"REAL\" WORK. HOWEVER, I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT LET ALL OF YOU KNOW HOW VERY MUCH I ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU -  MOST ESPECIALLY WITH JAKE. THERE WAS NEVER A QUESTION OR CONCERN THAT I HAD,  THAT WASN'T ANSWERED IN A MOST PROFESSIONAL MANNER. I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH ALL THE WORK THAT WAS COMPLETED FOR THE SCHOOL. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN COMPLIMENTS ARE GIVEN CONCERNING \"PAINTING\" I AM ALWAYS SURE TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE - TO YOU! I KNOW TOO THAT IT WAS NOT AN EASY TASK WORKING AROUND STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND STAFF."
