quote: "IT IS MY PLEASURE TO DOCUMENT THE GREAT WORK PROVIDED BY KARRAS PAINTING IN CREATING THE ORRICK GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER WITH A CONTRACT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $300,000. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE HISTORIC INTEGRITY OF OUR FIRST CLASS FACILITY, WE NEEDED A FIRST CLASS PAINTING CONTRACTOR. AND KARRAS PAINTING CERTAINLY FIT THE BILL.  THEIR PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS MADE THEM THE PERFECT PARTNER IN OUR REHABILITATION PROJECT. THEIR WORK HAS MADE OUR FACILITY."
